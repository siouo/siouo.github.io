                This ain't another love song, baby
                It's my way of putting feelers out
                All the traffic in my head's going crazy
                I'm gonna trust my heart right now
                And if it's better to bet on us, then I'll double down
                And if we end up in bed and I put the covers out
                And if I'm wrong, I'll just bury my head deep underground
                I gotta know
                Are you feeling the rush?
                If so, then I think I know what's going on
                And are we falling in love? Say yes or no
                Yes or no, yes or no
                Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us)
                If so, then I think I know what's (know what's) going on
                And are we falling in love? Say yes or no
                Yes or no, yes or no
                Everybody in this club so faded
                I'm trippin' over getting lost on you
                If we forever started out as strangers
                I think my ever after just came true
                If you could see what I see, then let's see what it's about
                We will go higher and higher but we're not looking down
                If it's a dream, there's no telling when I'll be coming 'round
                And I gotta know
                Are you feeling the rush?
                If so, then I think I know what's going on
                And are we falling in love? Say yes or no
                Yes or no, yes or no
                Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us)
                If so, then I think I know what's (know what's) going on
                And are we falling in love? Say yes or no
                Yes or no, yes or no
                Something about you
                Do you feel the way I do?
                There's magic in the room
                Tell me, do you feel it too?
                Something about you
                Do you feel the way I do?
                There's magic in the room
                Tell me, what we gonna do?
                Are you feeling the rush?
                If so, then I think I know what's going on
                And are we falling in love? Say yes or no
                Yes or no, yes or no (yeah, yeah, yeah)
                Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us)
                If so, then I think I know what's (know what's) going on
                And are we falling in love? Say yes or no (what's going on)
                Say yes or no, yes or no
